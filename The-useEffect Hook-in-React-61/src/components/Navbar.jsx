// EXPLAINATION

// CASE 1 WILL RUN TWO TIMES WHY CUZ WHENEVER ANY STATE IS CHANGED EG COUNT VALUSE CHANGES THEN WHOLE COMPONENT WILL RERENDER AGAIN. SAME WITHT HE NAVBAR THATS WHY 2 TIEMS YOU ARE GETTING THE CASE ONE RUN ON EVERY RENDER ALERT USEEFFECT.


// When a state (like `count`) changes in a React component, the component re-renders, and so do its child components (like `Navbar`). 

// - **Parent `useEffect`**: Runs on every render unless you specify a dependency array.  
// - **Child Component (`Navbar`)**: Re-renders due to the parent, but its `useEffect` only runs if its dependencies (like `color`) change.  

// This is why you see multiple alertsâ€”React is re-rendering components and triggering effects based on their dependency arrays.
